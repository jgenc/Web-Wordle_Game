## 💻 How to Run Locally

Because this project uses JavaScript Modules (`import` statements) and fetches external text files, you cannot simply open `index.html` in a browser. You must use a local server.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/wordle-web.git](https://github.com/yourusername/wordle-web.git)
    cd wordle-web
    ```

2.  **Start a Local Server:**
    * **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    * **Using Node (http-server):**
        ```bash
        npx http-server .
        ```

3.  **Open in Browser:**
    Go to `http://localhost:8000`

## 🏆 Leaderboard Logic

The game connects to a Firestore collection named `placemate`.
1.  When a player wins, their **Name**, **Time**, and **Date** are saved to the database.
2.  The Leaderboard screen queries the database, sorts by time (ascending), and limits the view to the top 10 fastest players.
